            Spots enemy players faster than he spots trains. Best geoguessr
            swiss train stations map player of the world (not anymore). Why
            isn't Train simulator an esports yet? Anyways we're sure he'd crush
            it!

            Actually plays for "Unicorn irgendöppis" instead of Bigchungus
